Personal portfolio web.

the web application is resume and brief introduction about me and my projects and hobbies and with a way to conact me but it doesn`t work in this case.

setup instruction is that i used a extension name live preivew to open the web application.

I used ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot to improve the design of my website and fix issues I encountered, such as the greeting text not displaying correctly and interactive buttons not working. These tools helped me learn easier and simpler ways to implement my ideas while enhancing both the look and functionality of the site.
